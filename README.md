My dotfiles

## Installing the dotfiles
I recommend GNU Stow to manage the symlinks. It should be packaged with the name stow on most distributions

Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/KurnuCat/dotfiles/
```

Enter the directory

```
cd dotfiles
```

Use stow on a wanted package for example bash

```
stow bash
```

If there are any conflicts delete the conflicting files.

You can also just install everything manually if you want to.
